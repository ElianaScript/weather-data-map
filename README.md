# Weather Data Map
A weather dashboard that allows users to check the weather for upcoming trips in different cities they are traveling to.
## Description
The Weather Data Map was created to allow users to input a city, and the site generates the weather outlook for that location.

## Usage
Type in whichever city you will be traveling to, and the site will give the user an overview of the current forecast and the forecast for the week ahead. If you would like to search for another city, then the browser will keep the data of the previous city search and you can click on it to revisit whenever the user would like.
